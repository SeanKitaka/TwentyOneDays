## Overview

An Issue that has become prevalent recently is the issue around discipline and being able to avoid procrastination. Especially with the introduction of tiktok and the increased use of social media apps, many have been able to voice their opinions and talk about their struggles with procrastination and being able to be consistent in performing tasks.
